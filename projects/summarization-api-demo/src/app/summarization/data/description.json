"Description\n\nThe fast-changing world of software development demands robust CI/CD solutions that go beyond traditional methods to address the complexities of modern pipelines. This practical guide presents proven design patterns to streamline your CI/CD processes, tackling pain points often overlooked by other resources. This book introduces continuous delivery design patterns to help practitioners and engineering teams design, adopt, and implement CI/CD. Drawing from decades of combined industry experience, the expert author team—including DevOps and cloud leader Garima Bajpai, industry expert Michel Schildmeijer, CI/CD framework creator Pawel Piwosz, and open source advocate Muktesh Mishra—provides invaluable insights from leading voices in the industry. The book lays a solid foundation by starting with the importance of CI/CD design patterns, components, and principles. You’ll learn strategies for scaling CI/CD with a focus on performance, security, measurements, and pipeline auditability, along with infrastructure and release automation. The book also covers advanced design patterns that integrate machine learning, generative AI, and near real-time CI/CD processes. By the end of this book, you’ll have a deep understanding of continuous delivery design patterns, a solid foundation for audits and controls, and be able to mitigate risks associated with the rapid integration of modern technology into the SDLC.\n\nWho is this book for?\n\nThis design patterns book is for senior software developers, software architects, SRE architects, DevOps architects, cloud architects and platform engineering teams looking to speed up the development process by adopting well-tested, proven development/design paradigms for continuous delivery and its adoption. You are expected to have a basic understanding of CI/CD concepts and be familiar with the cloud ecosystem, DevOps principles, and CI/CD pipelines.",
  "llm": "Description\n\nArtificial intelligence has undergone rapid advancements, and Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of this revolution. This LLM book offers insights into designing, training, and deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios by leveraging MLOps best practices. The guide walks you through building an LLM-powered twin that’s cost-effective, scalable, and modular. It moves beyond isolated Jupyter notebooks, focusing on how to build production-grade end-to-end LLM systems. Throughout this book, you will learn data engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and deployment. The hands-on approach to building the LLM Twin use case will help you implement MLOps components in your own projects. You will also explore cutting-edge advancements in the field, including inference optimization, preference alignment, and real-time data processing, making this a vital resource for those looking to apply LLMs in their projects. By the end of this book, you will be proficient in deploying LLMs that solve practical problems while maintaining low-latency and high-availability inference capabilities. Whether you are new to artificial intelligence or an experienced practitioner, this book delivers guidance and practical techniques that will deepen your understanding of LLMs and sharpen your ability to implement them effectively.\n\nWho is this book for?\n\nThis book is for AI engineers, NLP professionals, and LLM engineers looking to deepen their understanding of LLMs. Basic knowledge of LLMs and the Gen AI landscape, Python and AWS is recommended. Whether you are new to AI or looking to enhance your skills, this book provides comprehensive guidance on implementing LLMs in real-world scenarios"
